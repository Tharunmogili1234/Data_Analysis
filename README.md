Data Analytics with Power BI & Excel

# Overview:

This project demonstrates how to perform data analysis on large datasets using Power BI and Excel. It covers data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and insights extraction to support data-driven decision-making.

# Features:

Data Import & Cleaning: Efficiently load and clean large datasets in Excel.

Data Transformation: Use Power Query for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.

Advanced Analytics: Leverage DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculations and aggregations.

Interactive Dashboards: Create dynamic visualizations in Power BI.

Automated Reports: Generate and schedule reports for real-time insights.

Tech Stack

Microsoft Excel (for initial data processing and basic visualization)

Power BI (for advanced data visualization and reporting)

Power Query & DAX (for data transformation and calculations)
